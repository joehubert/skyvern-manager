I'm going to use AI to create a software project called Skyvern-manager.
It will provide utility features to users of the Skyvern (skyvern.com) cloud platform.
The application will have a server written in TypeScript that provides the API.
The front end will be written with Next.js.

The UI layout will be a typical: left hand naviation, right hand content pattern.

I am going to start with one feature that will be labeled Workflow Doc in the navigation panel.
In summary, this feature will:
* Collect all the workflows from Skyvern cloud, given a filter config to select certain workflows, and a field config to select certain fields in the workflow object, possibly filtered by parameters of.
* These filters configs will be editable from the front end as simple json structures.
* For example, the filter to select certain workflows might look like this:
{ 
    status : "published",
    folder_id : ["fld_aabbccdddeee"]
}
* The config for included fields could look like this:
{
  "fields": [
    "workflow_permanent_id",
    "title",
    "description",
    "workflow_definition.parameters.key",
    "workflow_definition.parameters.description",
    "workflow_definition.parameters.workflow_parameter_type"
    "webhook_callback_url"

  ],
  "filters": [
    {
      "field": "workflow_definition.parameters.parameter_type",
      "operator": "eq",
      "value": "workflow"
    }
  ]
}
* The feature will support an html template that will drive the rendering of the output (each workflow entry.) I will rely on the AI to build a good template but the basic idea is something like this:
<div class="title">{title}</div>
<div class="description">{description}</div>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="param_key">{workflow_definition.parameters.key}</td>
<td class="param_type">{workflow_definition.parameters.parameter_type}</td>
<td class="param_description">{workflow_definition.parameters.descriptiony}</td>
</tr>
</table>
<div class="webhook_callback_url>{webhook_callback_url}</div>
* The template will be editable in the UI.
* The project will include an appropriate stylesheet that will be managed outside of the features of this project.

Here are some resources that will help you:
* Attached files (to this project) for the workflows and workflow json schema.
* Links to Skyvern API documentation:
    * https://www.skyvern.com/docs/api-reference/api-reference/workflows/get-workflows
    * https://www.skyvern.com/docs/api-reference/api-reference/workflows/get-workflow

* Skyvern API calls require and API key which will be stored in an environment file.

Your goal is to create a series of documents that will effectively guide Claude Code in the creation of this project.
Ask me any clarifying questions necessary to optimize your output. 
When you have everything you need, generate the instruction files.
