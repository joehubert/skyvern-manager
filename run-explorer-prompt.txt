I'm going to use AI to create a software project called Skyvern-manager.
It will provide utility features to users of the Skyvern (skyvern.com) cloud platform.
The application will have a server written in TypeScript that provides the API.
The front end will be written with Next.js.

The UI layout will be a typical: left hand naviation, right hand content pattern.

Also see the file attached to this project: PROJECCT-SUMMARY.md

The purpose of this feature is to:
* Collect relevant workflow run objects from the Skyvern cloud service
* Allow the user to dynamically type json paths and see what values are in the object

In summary, this feature will:
* Collect a page of workflow runs from Skyvern cloud sequentially on demand, starting with the collection of one page.
   * .env will have a collection of run status to exclude, by default: queued, running
* The .env file will include parameters for the page size for the workflow run connection which is an API parameter.
* Since the filtering for the "list workflow runs" with Skyvern is limited, there will be client-side filtering of the runs after they are returned by the API. This filtering includes:
* This feature will re-use existing workflow filters defined for other features
* The left hand naviation label for this feature will be: Workflow Run Explorer

The collected workflow runs will be displayed in a table with these columns:
* Run ID - workflow_run_id
* Workflow - workflow_title
* Status - status
* Created At - created_at

When user clicks a workflow run row in the table/list, the system will display a page for that workflow run.
These are the UI elements:
* Text box labeled JSON Path
    * This will allow the user to type a full json path to a property with the workflow run object
    * The text will suggest possible values based on text entered and context
* A Value button that determines the value based on the json path and the current workflow run object
* A display are to show that value
* A scrollable read-only area with the workflow run object nicely formatted.

Here are some resources that will help you:
* Attached files (to this project) for the workflow runs and workflow json schema.
* Links to Skyvern API documentation:
    * https://www.skyvern.com/docs/api-reference/api-reference/workflows/get-workflows
    * https://www.skyvern.com/docs/api-reference/api-reference/workflow-runs/get-workflow-runs

* Skyvern API calls require and API key which is stored in .env file: SKYVERN_API_KEY

Your goal is to create a series of documents that will effectively guide Claude Code in the creation of this project.
Ask me any clarifying questions necessary to optimize your output. 
When you have everything you need, generate the instruction files.
